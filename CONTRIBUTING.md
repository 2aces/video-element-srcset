## Bugs & Questions

**Before posting, do a search to make sure your issue or questions hasn't already been reported or discussed.** If no matching issue exists, go ahead and create one. Please be sure to include all of the following:

2. [A reduced test case.](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/)
	- Clearly demonstrate the bug or issue.
	- Include the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
	- A link to your production site is not a reduced test case.
3. The browser and OS that you're using.

Duplicates and issues without a reduced test case may be closed without comment.
